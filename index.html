            <p>Today is all about you—the most beautiful soul I’ve ever known. From the moment you came into my life, everything changed for the better. You’ve filled my days with laughter, my heart with warmth, and my life with a happiness I never thought was possible. I love how your smile can light up even my darkest days, how your voice feels like the sweetest melody, and how your presence makes everything feel just right.</p>
